## Understanding the Powder Fire Suppression System Market

Powder fire suppression systems use dry chemical agents, such as sodium bicarbonate or monoammonium phosphate, to extinguish fires by interrupting chemical reactions. Effective against Class A, B, and C fires, these systems are widely used in industrial facilities, data centers, and commercial kitchens, protecting 15% of high-risk environments, per 2023 NFPA reports. The 2022 valuation of US\$4.2 billion highlights their critical role, with the projected rise to US\$6.5 billion by 2031 driven by the industrial segment, which held a 40% share in 2022 due to its use in 20% of manufacturing plants, per TMR. The 4.7% CAGR aligns with the US\$30 billion global fire suppression market's steady growth.
